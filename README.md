- **Database**: [InstantDB](https://instantdb.com) for primary user/chat threads storage and Supabase bucket for image storage
- **Styling**: [TailwindCSS](https://tailwindcss.com) with [shadcn/ui](https://ui.shadcn.com/)
- **Language**: TypeScript
- **Hosting**: [Vercel](https://vercel.com/)

> ## üöÄ Getting Started
### Prerequisites
- Node.js 18+ installed
- API keys for your chosen model providers
- InstantDB account for authentication and database
- Supabase account for image generation features
- Backend services (InstantDB and Supabase) configured as detailed in the 'Backend Setup' section.

### Installation
1. Clone the repository
```bash
git clone https://github.com/Vinitj088/AyleChat.git

> ## Backend Setup

### InstantDB Setup
InstantDB serves as the primary database for user authentication and chat/thread storage:

1. **Create an InstantDB account** at [https://instantdb.com](https://instantdb.com)
2. **Create a new app** in your InstantDB dashboard
3. **Configure your environment variables**:
   * Find your **App ID** and **Admin Token** in your InstantDB dashboard
   * Add these to your `.env.local` file:
   ```env
   NEXT_PUBLIC_INSTANT_APP_ID=YOUR_INSTANT_APP_ID
   INSTANT_ADMIN_TOKEN=YOUR_INSTANT_ADMIN_TOKEN
   ```

### Supabase Setup
Supabase provides additional authentication features and user data storage:

1. **Create a Supabase account** at [https://supabase.com](https://supabase.com)
2. **Create a new project**
3. **Get your credentials**:
   * Go to Settings > API in your Supabase dashboard
   * Find your **Project URL** and **anon/public key**
   * Add these to your `.env.local` file:
   ```env
   NEXT_PUBLIC_SUPABASE_URL=YOUR_SUPABASE_PROJECT_URL
   NEXT_PUBLIC_SUPABASE_ANON_KEY=YOUR_SUPABASE_ANON_KEY
   ```

> ## Database Schema & Permissions

This application uses **InstantDB** as the primary database for authentication and chat/thread storage. InstantDB provides real-time synchronization and built-in authentication capabilities that streamline the development process.

### InstantDB Usage
- **Authentication**: Handles user registration, login, and session management
- **Chat Storage**: Stores all chat messages, threads, and conversation history
- **Real-time Updates**: Provides live synchronization across all connected clients

### Schema & Permissions Reference
The database schema and permissions configuration can be found in the following files within this repository:
- **Schema Definition**: `instant.schema.ts` - Contains the database table definitions and relationships
- **Permissions Configuration**: `instant.perms.ts` - Defines user access controls and data permissions

These files serve as a reference for setting up your InstantDB instance and understanding the data structure used by the application.
