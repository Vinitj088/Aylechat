```
# Exa API
EXA_API_KEY=your-api-key-here

# Auth (required)
DATABASE_URL=your-postgres-url
NEXTAUTH_SECRET=your-nextauth-secret-key
NEXTAUTH_URL=http://localhost:3000

# Redis (required for chat history)
UPSTASH_REDIS_REST_URL=your_upstash_redis_url
UPSTASH_REDIS_REST_TOKEN=your_upstash_redis_token
```

4. Run the development server

## üîê Authentication System

This application uses NextAuth.js as the primary authentication system, with custom extensions for enhanced functionality:

### Features

- Secure credential-based authentication
- JWT session management
- Persistent user sessions
- Database integration with PostgreSQL
- Custom signup and profile management
- Protected API routes and pages

### Usage

The app provides a centralized authentication hook that should be used in all components:

```tsx
import { useAuth } from '@/lib/hooks/useAuth';

function MyComponent() {
  const { user, isAuthenticated, signIn, signUp, signOut } = useAuth();
  
  // Use these methods and state for auth operations
}
```

For server-side authentication checking, use NextAuth's built-in methods.
