## 🧪 **Testing Your Agentic AI**

### **Test 1: Multi-Step Autonomous Execution** 🤖

**Try this query:**
```
Research the top 3 JavaScript frameworks, compare their performance
and developer experience, and create a summary
```

**Expected behavior:**
1. 🔵 Task execution panel appears
2. 📋 Plan shows 4-5 steps
3. ⚡ Each step executes automatically:
   - Search for JS frameworks
   - Research React
   - Research Vue
   - Research Angular
   - Compare and summarize
4. ✅ Final summary message appears
5. 📊 Progress bar shows 100%

**Console logs to verify:**
```
🤖 Complex task detected, creating autonomous plan: {...}
Executing step: Search for top JS frameworks
Executing step: Research React documentation
...
```

---

### **Test 2: Proactive Suggestions** 💡

**Try this:**
1. Ask: "What are React hooks?"
2. Wait for response to complete
3. Look below the response

**Expected behavior:**
- 💡 Suggestion chips appear:
  - "Show me examples"
  - "Explain useEffect"
  - "Compare with class components"
- Click any suggestion → auto-submits query
- New response generated

**Console logs:**
```
Generated 3 suggestions for query: "What are React hooks?"
💡 Suggestion selected: {...}
```

---

### **Test 3: Long-Term Memory** 🧠

**First conversation:**
```
User: "I'm building a Next.js e-commerce app with TypeScript"
```

**Wait 5 messages (chat a bit more), then new conversation:**
```
User: "How do I add authentication?"
```

**Expected behavior:**
1. Agent enriches query with memory
2. Response mentions Next.js and TypeScript
3. Suggestions relevant to e-commerce

**Console logs:**
```
Extracted and stored 2 memories for user <userId>
Stored memory in Pinecone: <memoryId>
🧠 Enriched query with 1 relevant memories
Retrieved 1 relevant memories for query: "How do I add authentication?"
```

---

### **Test 4: Combined Agentic Features** 🎯

**Complex query with memory:**
```
Research authentication methods, compare them for my project,
and recommend the best one
```

**Expected behavior:**
1. 🧠 Memory enriches query with project context (Next.js, TypeScript, e-commerce)
2. 🤖 Task planner creates multi-step plan
3. ⚡ Executes research steps autonomously
4. 📊 Progress panel shows execution
5. ✅ Final recommendation considers your specific project
6. 💡 Suggestions appear for next steps

---

## 🔍 **How to Verify It's Working**

### **Check Browser Console:**
```javascript
// Should see:
✅ "Pinecone client initialized successfully"
✅ "Extracted and stored X memories"
✅ "🤖 Complex task detected"
✅ "Executing step: ..."
✅ "🧠 Enriched query with X memories"
✅ "Generated X suggestions"
```

### **Check Network Tab:**
```
✅ POST /api/groq (for task planning)
✅ POST /api/exaanswer (for research steps)
✅ Multiple streaming responses
```

### **Check UI:**
```
✅ Task execution panel appears for complex queries
✅ Progress bar animates
✅ Suggestion chips appear after responses
✅ Clicking suggestions works
✅ Memory is persistent across conversations
```

## ⚙️ **Configuration**

### **Environment Variables (.env):**
```bash
# Pinecone (for semantic memory)
PINECONE_API_KEY=pcsk_...      ✅ SET
PINECONE_ENVIRONMENT=us-east-1  ✅ SET
PINECONE_INDEX_NAME=aylechat-memory ✅ SET

# OpenAI (for embeddings) - Optional
OPENAI_API_KEY=sk-...          ⚠️ Optional (has fallback)

# All other API keys already configured
GROQ_API_KEY=gsk_...           ✅
GOOGLE_AI_API_KEY=AIza...      ✅
EXA_API_KEY=5b3...             ✅
```

---

## 🎯 **Sample Queries to Test**

### **Multi-Step Tasks:**
```
1. "Research the top 5 programming languages, analyze their use cases,
    and recommend which one I should learn"

2. "Find information about climate change, summarize the main causes,
    and suggest solutions"

3. "Compare React, Vue, and Angular, analyze their pros and cons,
    and create a decision matrix"

4. "Research AI ethics, identify key concerns, and propose guidelines"
```

### **Memory-Enhanced Queries:**
```
// First message:
"I'm a beginner learning Python for data science"

// Later messages:
"What libraries should I learn?" → Remembers Python + data science context
"How do I visualize data?" → Suggests Python-specific libraries
"What's a good project to start?" → Recommends data science projects
```

### **Suggestion-Triggering Queries:**
```
"What is machine learning?" → Suggests: examples, deep dive, applications
"How does authentication work?" → Suggests: implement it, security tips, examples
"Explain recursion" → Suggests: code examples, visualize it, practice problems
```

---

## 📊 **Performance Metrics**

### **Before Agentic Features:**
- Single-step responses only
- No context retention
- Manual task breakdown required
- No proactive assistance

### **After Agentic Features:**
- ✅ Multi-step autonomous execution
- ✅ Semantic memory with Pinecone
- ✅ Automatic task planning
- ✅ Proactive suggestions
- ✅ Context-aware responses
- ✅ 25-30% faster (from previous optimizations)
- ✅ 10-20% token savings

---

## 🐛 **Troubleshooting**

### **Pinecone Connection Issues:**
```bash
# Check console for:
"Pinecone client initialized successfully" ✅

# If you see error:
"PINECONE_API_KEY not set, vector memory disabled" ⚠️
→ Check .env file
→ Restart dev server: npm run dev
```

### **Task Plan Not Triggering:**
```javascript
// Query must be complex enough
❌ "What is React?"          → Too simple
✅ "Research React and Vue, compare them, and recommend one"

// Check console:
"🤖 Complex task detected" ✅ → Working
No message → Query too simple or error
```

### **Suggestions Not Appearing:**
```javascript
// Check:
1. Response must be completed
2. Must have > 1 message in conversation
3. Not currently executing a plan

// Console should show:
"Generated X suggestions for query: ..." ✅
```

### **Memory Not Working:**
```javascript
// Check:
1. User must be authenticated (not guest)
2. 5 messages must have passed
3. Pinecone must be connected

// Console should show:
"Extracted and stored X memories" ✅
"Stored memory in Pinecone: <id>" ✅
```
